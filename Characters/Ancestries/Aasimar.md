## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Aasimar resemble their parentage in shape and size, but each one is marked by the celestial influence in their spirit. Every aasimar is born with a celestial mark on their body, which looks akin to a scar, birthmark or a tattoo. These markings match the eye colour of the aasimar and glow faintly just like them. Celestial marks appear in a variety of shapes and sizes, for some they are mere dots, while others have half their bodies covered with exquisite patterns. Some marks even change as an aasimar matures, shrinking or growing in size and complexity.  
While aasimar lack other permanent, physical mutations, whenever they unleash the energy from within themselves, their mutated spirits partially materialize, forming temporary quasi-physical apparitions of light. These commonly include: halos of fire, feathery wings, additional eyes, interlocking wheels of eyes and more.

## Civilization
#### History
The Aasimar are a strand of people born from mutations induced by celestial powers. More specifically, their origins can be traced back to three meteorites that have crashed into Vendria in the times of old. The three aasimar lineages are each connected to one of these stones, each of which felled upon a different region in Vendria. The first and the oldest one was found on the grounds of the Commonwealth of Astros, the second on the grounds of Shayin, and the last one, found during the Empire's conquer of the lands of Nael.
#### Major Organizations
Godhand, Blessed Church of Calm and Clear Skies, the Iron Battalion.
#### Common Taboos
Revealing their birthmark. (Shayin)  
Hiding their birthmark. (Nael)  
Stagnation / Sloth.
#### Historical figures

- Votnir the Black, supposed greatest mage of the Ring of Lies whose magics befuddled mortals and outsiders alike.
- Iron Friar, creator of the now mostly defunct Iron Battalion, a fascist paramilitary organization that preached the divinity and inherent superiority of the aasimar over all other mortals.
