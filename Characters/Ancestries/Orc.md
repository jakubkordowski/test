## Civilization
#### History
In ancient times, orcs were the most numerous and most powerful lineage found of the plains of Khez, despite being considered a younger race by the likes of the ancient skinwalkers and the goblinoids. Despite their advantage over the other people of the land and their war-based culture, orcs were the first to offer peace treaties and try to form unions with their neighbours.  
Then the The Astrian Empire arrived to the plains. Orcs, who were in the middle of their metallurgic age, were crushed and enslaved by the Empire, like most other peoples unwilling to bend the knee to the empire. The orcs remained indomitable and wild spirited the whole time, opposing the Empire until its fall and their last, successful rebellion.  
After the fall, orcs were the main force leading the rebirth of Khez as a free region.
