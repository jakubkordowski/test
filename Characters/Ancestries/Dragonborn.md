## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Dragonborn resemble draconic humanoids. Their bodies are most often covered in vivid scales of one of five colours, with a discoloured underbelly. Their hands and feet end in claws, and their reptilian maws are filled with sharp teeth (dragonborn are polyphyodonts). Like their monstrous counterparts, the heads of dragonborn are oftentimes adorned with ridges, spikes, frills or spines. While they don't require them because of their bipedalism, some dragonborn are still born with functioning tails. Even more rarely, certain dragonborn can be born with a vestigial tail or wings.
#### Habitats
Tropical and subtropical grasslands and marshes.
#### Diet
Omnivorous.
#### Growth rate
Dragonborn develop physical maturity by age 12 and mental maturity by 15.
## Civilization
#### History
Dragonborn are believed to be one of, if not the oldest of the humanoid races of Hirana, though many elves will fight about it. The connection the dragonborn have with ancient dragons is not fully understood nor known but according to stories passed down in dragonborn communities, the dragons are the ancestors of the race. The draonborn were essential in establishing the kingdom of Hirana and their diplomatic approach to it saved them and elves from many conflicts. Ever since, the dragonborn were one of the staple lineages of Hirana.

**Breath Weapon.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of destructive energy.

The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage, or half as much on a successful save. This damage increases to 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 4d10 at 17th level.
