## Civilization
#### History
Quetzpalin are all that is left of the first natives of the many islands of the archipelago now known as Qan. Originally, multiple subspecies of different reptilian folk settled among the tall trees and even taller volcanoes of Qan. While not necessarily peaceful, the conflicts between the tribes never escalated into anything major. That is, until the N'aga began their war efforts. In a short time, thanks to their technological and magical advancements, the N'aga conquered and enslaved what they once considered their cousins. Now, they were just simple beasts of burden.  
It wasn't until the quetzpalin joined forces with the similarly enslaved humans and orans and years of rebellion that they managed to free themselves from their opressors and cause the fall of the N'aga Dominion.  
But that was not the end of conflict that quetzpalin wished for. After the fall of their enemy, it didn't take long for conflict to escalate between the previous allies. Soon, they turned on each other, each vying for control of the now abandoned N'aga cities. While the quetzpalin did gain control of multiple of them, it was not enough. For they have been enslaved for hundreds if not thousands of years, and as such believed they deserved to control most of what was left by the N'aga. Both the humans and orans of Qan believed a similar ideologies, thus continuing the years of conflict.  
After outsiders started making frequent contact with Qan and its people, the three peoples of Qan entered a "peace", in name only. In reality, each of the governments supported "rebellious freedom fighters" that openly followed the old ideology.
