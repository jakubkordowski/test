## Civilization
#### History
Tieflings are a strand of people born from mutations induced by the vile powers of fiends. Such corruptions can often be traced back to either major world events that tainted Vendria with fiendish magics or sometimes due to a particular ancestors direct dealing with a fiend, such as a powerful devilish pact or consuming demon flesh.  
Cinder tieflings trace the fiendish influence in their blood to the devils of the Hells, most often due to devilish pacts with susceptible mortals. The first of these tieflings were born on the deserts of Shayin, as part of Archmage Solomon's studies. Thanks to the archmage and her politics, tieflings face little prosecution in the lands of Shayin.  
Ash tieflings trace the fiendish influence in their blood to the demons of the Abyss, most often due to havoc wrecked by demons summoned to the mortal realm. The first of these tieflings were born on the plains of Khez. They were considered to be born for combat and often were taken away from their families to fight.  
Soot tieflings trace the fiendish influence in their blood to the chorts of Pandeomonium, most often due to usage of chort armaments. The first of these tieflings were born in the Empire of Astros, as part of secret experimentations with outer planes of existance.
