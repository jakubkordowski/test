## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Orans resemble humanoids with reptilian and floral influence. Shorter than average humanoids, the orans have skin in shades of green, usually more vibrant if their diet consists of apt amounts of drinking water. Their ears are short and pointed and their vibrantly coloured eyes resemble those of snakes. Instead of hair foliage, flowers, vines, moss and the like sprout from their heads, often stylized in a way resembling hair. Orans are sexually monomorphic with flat chests, narrow shoulders and broad hips. Orans possess the ability to extend their circulatory system outside of their body and use it to absorb liquids. Similarly, they can consume liquids by absorbing them through their skin. Oran blood is orange in colour, is glossy like sap and smells and tastes sweet.
#### Habitats
Tropical forests and grasslands.
#### Diet
Omnivorous, but primarily hydrovorous.
#### Growth rate
Oran reach physical and mental maturity in their late teens.
## Civilization
#### History
The Oran were alchemically crafted by the N'aga to serve as eternal slaves. Their serpentine overlords regretted the creation as the second Oran generation began to rebel against them. After years of rebellion the Oran were free with the fall of the N'aga Dominion.  
But that was not the end of conflict that the Oran wished for, for after the fall of their enemy, their previous allies turned on them and each other, each vying for control of the now abandoned N'aga cities. While Oran have gained control of multiple of them, it was not enough. They were cursed since their birth, and as such believed they deserved to now control all that was left by the N'aga, as a form of repentance. Both the humans and lizardfolk of Qan believed a similar ideology, thus continuing the years of conflict.  
After outsiders started making frequent contact with Qan and its people, the three peoples of Qan entered a "peace", in name only. In reality, each of the governments supported "rebellious freedom fighters" that openly followed the old ideology. But the hidden conflict allowed some Oran to abandon the archipelago, while allowing others to trade with the outsiders for better combat equipment.

**Taking Root.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a special attack made by extending your roots into another creature's body. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d4 Necrotic damage and if the creature isn't a Construct or Undead, you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. This damage increases to 3d4 at 5th level, 4d4 at 11th, and 5d4 at 17th. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
