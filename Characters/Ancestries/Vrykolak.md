## Basic information

#### Anatomy
Vrykolaks resemble massive humanoid canines. They are taller than average humanoids, with lean musculature. Their skin is usually in black and grey colors, with short fur in black, white, grey and red hues. The pattern on their fur is hereditary, but commonly difficult for non-Vrykolaks to recognize. Some Vrykolaks besides their full-body fur also sport a crest-like mane in dirty white, grey and reddish shades. They have large, blunt, non-retractable claws and sharp, bone-crushing fangs. Vrykolaks are sexually dimorphic, with females on average being larger, having thicker fur and longer tails.
#### Habitats
Temperate steppes and grasslands.
#### Diet
Omnivorous, but primarily carnivorous.
#### Growth rate
Vrykolaks reach physical and mental maturity at around 14 years of age.
## Civilization
#### History
Vrykolaks are descendants of a strand of ancient, animalistics humanoids, who in the past had spread throughout the whole world. This particular tribe settled on the plains today known as Khez. Due to a lack of resources and the constant combats between all the peoples of the land, many people took drastic measures to ensure the safety of their clans. The ancestors of Vrykolaks in particular were forced to escape famine and the lack of resources through feeding on anything and everything they could find, which included their deceased families, their enemies, as well as corpses of outsiders, particularly war demons that were popular in the region at the time.  
As all the people of Khez, the Vrykolaks came to be enslaved during the conquests of the Empire and only regained their freedom after the birth of Khez.
#### Major Organizations
White Cloth Guild, Spawns of Anarchy, Sundered Will.
#### Common Taboos
Betrayal, especially of family.  
Desecration of the dead.  
Consumption of alcohol.
#### Historical figures

- Packlord Praskoya, the last of the Packlords who stood against the Empire, who slowed down the conquest of Khez by many grueling years.
- Marcel Spotfur, semi-legendary figure of a trickster who wanders the world getting into trouble with his mischief, supposedly based on one of the greatest thieves and scammers in Khezian history.
