## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Genasi resemble humanoids mutated by elemental energies, with each subspecies covering a wide range of different possible mutations. Despite widely different appearances, genasi subspecies can interbreed without a problem.  
Air genasi tend to have skin, hair and eyes in cold colours, like silver, pale blue or purple. Some common mutations include: a lower body temperature, breathy voices marked by faint echoes or reverb, hair and clothing moving as if tousled by a constant breeze, glowing veins resembling lightning.  
Earth genasi tend to have skin in earthly, crystalline or even metallic colours. Some common mutations include: excreting dust, ash, sand or mud as if sweat, skin appearing as if made of polished metal or gemstones, parts of skin covered in a coating of tiny crystals, having fissures in their flesh.  
Fire genasi tend to have skin in flaming red, coal-black or ash-grey colours, with bright, almost glowing eyes. Some common mutations include: sprouting fire instead of hair, hair turning into fire under intense emotion, increased body temperature, glowing veins and blood.  
Water genasi tend to have skin in blue and green colours, with hair colours ranging from a deep, muddy blue to a bright, foamy white. Some common mutations include: beads of moisture collecting on skin and hair, overlarge fish-like eyes, hair floating as if underwater, sweat that smells like fresh rain or sea water.
#### Habitats
Subtropical and temperate deserts.
#### Diet
Omnivorous.
#### Growth rate
Genasi reach mental and physical maturity in their late teens.
## Civilization
#### History
In ancient times, the lands of Shayin were ruled by a people now only known as the Hellions. As they betrayed the gods, a maelstrom of incredible power ravaged through their lands. Their souls were swept away from their bodies and their lands were forever covered in dust and sands. Such was their divine punishment for following the Twin Beasts.  
The genasi are said to be the descendants of the survivors of that magical calamity, who were permanently changed by the raw, elemental powers of the storms now common in the lands of Shayin. The genasi were the first to learn how to read the storms and the sands, how to predict the movements of the most dangerous parts of Shayin and how to counter them enough to return to their ancestral home. It was only thanks to these studies that the lands of Shayin were inhibited once again.
#### Major Organizations
