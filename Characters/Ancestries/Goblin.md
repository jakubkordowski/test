## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Goblins resemble humanoids of short stature, with large, protruding ears (that unlike many humanoids they can move). Goblins tend to have skin in yellow-green shades, but though less common, goblins with red, blue and other shades of skin do exist. Their eyes are small, beady and tend to have vibrant colours, like bright yellow or red. Goblin fur tends to be short, scruffy and grow thick on the end of their ears and on their forearms. Goblins have an extremely resilient set of permanent teeth.
#### Habitats
Any.
#### Diet
Omnivorous, but primarily insectivorours.
#### Growth rate
Goblins reach physical and mental maturity at around age 12.
## Civilization
#### History
Goblins are the smallest and weakest of all goblinoids. Goblinoids have a long history of opposing many nations and civilizations as a whole, apparently in the service of a creature they call their God. With no lands of their own, goblinoids formed warbands that roamed the lands of Vendria and pillaged their way through. Due to their culture of might makes right and survival of the fittest, the bigger and stronger the goblinoid, the better position they had in the warband and the more they could abuse their lower ranked cousins. Despite mutual hatred being common amongst the goblinoid lineages, it is rare for them to defect from their service to their Master.  
During the Astrian Empire's conquest of the western continent, the unthinkable happened as multiple groups of goblins abandoned their warbands and attempted to surrender to the Astrian troops in an attempt to remove themselves from other goblinoids, and in turn, their Master. Surprisingly, a few officers of the Empire saw this as an opportunity to learn more of the goblinoids and so they were allowed to join the Empire, albeit as more tools and experiments than people. Despite that, goblins found themselves communities that survived even the fall of the Empire. The majority of goblin who did not desert their warbands have been anihilited and driven to near extinction during the viscious skirmishes with the Empire, campaigneers and other warbands.
