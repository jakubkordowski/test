## Civilization
#### History
During the conquests of the Astrian Empire, a group of arcane researchers performed a number of inhumane tests on various races, one of them being the elves. The main reason for that was the elves' powerful and natural connection to magic, the highest recorded in all humanoid races. The experiments sought to decrease the strength of the connection and see how that would impact the elven people. The results of such a permanent change was the birth of the elvar, a peoples resembling elves yet different from them.  
It wasn't until the fall of the Empire that the elvar gained full freedom from their oppressors, yet life was still not easy from them. The elves looked and treated them with pity and some even shame or hatred, leading major groups of elvar to abandon their ancestral homes and travel to new lands, unrestrained by the chains of history.
