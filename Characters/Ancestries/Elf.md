## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Elves resemble tall, lean humanoids with long, pointed ears and big eyes lacking visible pupils. Unlike most other species, elves seem to stop physically aging during their early adulthood. Elven skeletons appear to be lighter than those of other species due to partially pneumatized bones, while their joints tend to be more flexible.  
Dawn elves tend to have paler skin than their cousins, with light coloured hair and eyes.  
Dusk elves tend to have darker skin than their cousins, with warm coloured eyes.  
Solar elves tend to have skin with colouration similar to tree bark, with eyes and hair coloured like foliage.
#### Habitats
Any.
#### Diet
Omnivorous, but primarily herbivorous.
#### Growth rate
Elves reach physical maturity in their late twenties but because they tie mental maturity to life experiences, they aren't considered mentally mature until the end of their first century.
## Civilization
#### History
According to elvish history, long before the current elves walked the lands, there existed a group of immortal people spread far and wide through all the lands of Vendria, known today as the True Elves. Elves of today consider themselves the descendants of said group, who have left the lands in their care.  
The dawn elves originate from the lands today known as Hirana and pride themselves in being the lands' first inhabitants, often fighting with dragonborn for the title. It were the dawn elves that first saw how weak all people of their land were against the forces of nature and monstrosities lurking therein and so they were the first to push for a gathering of people under a single banner, a single nation.  
The dusk elves, while also originating from Hirana, have notably settled the lands after their cousins. Unlike their brethren, these elves ventured into the less occupied underground, carving their settlements in deep caverns below. That was how the elven people stumbled upon the dwarven clans who were also making their homes under the same lands. The two peoples formed a union based on similar goals and ideas, and supported each other in expanding and acclimating to underground life.  
The solar elves, originally called just elves or sometimes wild elves, feral elves or forest elves, first settled in the heavily forested areas of what at the time were the lands of Nael, which today are part of Bergov. For a while, the elves lead a mostly secluded lifestyle, avoiding the other peoples of the land. It wasn't until their dwarven neighbours began pushing into the elven lands in an attempt to expand their kingdom that the elves fully revealed themselves to the other peoples of the lands. From that day, the elves and dwarves of the regions warred with each other over land and resources. Their conflicts came to an abrupt end when the quickly advancing nation of humans invaded both lands and used them as stepping stones for their nation.
