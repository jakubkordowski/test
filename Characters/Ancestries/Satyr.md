## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Satyrs resemble animalistic humanoids. All satyrs possess a short, scruffy tail, a pair of furry legs and cloven feet. Some possess more other animalistic features, such as: elongated, floppy ears; horizontal slit-shaped pupils; flat noses; more or less fur; longer, semi-prehensile tails and the like.  
The heads of winter satyrs are adorned with antlers, like those of deer, moose, reindeer or the like.  
The heads of summer satyrs are adorned with horns, like those of goat, sheep, antelope or the like.
#### Habitats
Temperate forests and mountains.
#### Diet
Omnivorous, but primarily herbivorous.
#### Growth rate
Satyrs reach physical and mental maturity in their early twenties.
## Civilization
#### History
The fae of Bergov had always been a menace, especially in the early Ages. Once upon a time, a tribe of animalistic humanoids wandered too far into a dense forest, seeking a new home. Unknown to them, the forest was already home to the fae, who under the rules of Hospitality, welcomed the people with open arms, intending to never let them go back. But just as fae trick people, there are ways to trick the fae.  
The people that came back from the World Above came to be known as satyrs but they no longer resembled the people who wandered into the forest. Instead, their minds and bodies adapted to the different, confusing realm of fairies.
