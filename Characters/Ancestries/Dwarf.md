## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Dwarves resemble humanoids of short stature, with wide bodies, short limbs and large projecting noses. Dwarven skeletons, especially their skulls, are much tougher than those of most humanoids with traces of stones and metals in them. On average, dwarven hair grows faster, longer and from a younger age than in other species.  
Hill dwarves tend to be wider than their cousins, with broader shoulders and foreheads and commonly with darker skin and hair.  
Mountain dwarves tend to be leaner than their cousins, and commonly with paler skin and brighter hair.  
Cave dwarves tend to be taller than their cousins, and have skin in pale grey and blue shades (resembling argyria), with pale coloured hair.
#### Habitats
Polar and temperate mountains and caves.
#### Diet
Omnivorous.
#### Growth rate
Dwarves mature physically at the same rate as humans but reach mental maturity around the middle of their first century.
## Civilization
#### History
Not much is known about the dwarves' ancient history or how they have settled so far across the lands of Vendria. In ancient times of Bergov, the dwarven clans grouped together under the leadership of a powerful king and carved a migthy kingdom into the even mightier mountains. These same dwarves warred with their southern neighbours, the forest dwelling elves. It wasn't until a quickly advancing force of humans defeated both nations and established their own nation that the two lineages stopped their wars.  
In ancient times of Hirana, the dwarves were most famous for the many cities they have sculpted in the vast undergrounds of the land. While they never established an official nation, they had a powerful union with the elves of the region that similarly to them could not stand sunlight. When envoys of the yet to be born kingdom of Hirana offered the union a partnership to build a new nation, the dwarven clans accepted the proposal.  
In ancient times of Varholt, it is said that the cunning dwarves fought against the giants who ruled the frozen lands. This adversity vanished as the Vurms spread their tyranny throughout the lands and the dwarven clans joined forces with the other humanoid residents of Varholt to oppose and dethrone their powerful enemies.
