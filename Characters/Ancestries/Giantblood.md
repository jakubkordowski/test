## Basic information
#### Anatomy
Giantbloods (loose translation of "Oll", the name in their own language) resemble giant humanoids. Despite being considered a single species and having no issues with interbreeding, the three known subspecies of giantbloods vary greatly in appearance and biology.  
Skjoll have rough skin in grey shades, that is naturally resistant to the cold and sharp wind, with no hair. Some skjoll possess patches of discoloured skin mostly in brown and black shades. They have noticeably bony and prominent brow ridges and some have calcified dermal deposits on their bodies.  
Tholl tend to have skin in colour ranging from pale purple to dim grey. All tholl have only one eye but it is not consistent how it appears. Some have a singular, big bulging eye in the middle of their face, some have one atrophied, vestigial eye socket while the other, working eye sits on the other half of their face, some have an eye on their forehead with skin covering where most humanoids have eye sockets.  
Vaoll have bovine features, though not all of them have the same features. Some common vaoll features include: hooved feet; a short tail with a tuft of fur at the end; horns; fur that covers most of their body; flat, bovine noses; or large, floppy ears. These features do not appear to be hereditary.
#### Habitats
Polar mountains, forests and deserts.
#### Diet
Omnivorous.
#### Growth rate
Giantbloods reach physical maturity at the same rate as humans, but reach mental maturity in their fifties.
## Civilization
#### History
According to the stories of the giantbloods, they were formed by the giants, left on the frozen lands of Varholt to care for Vendria in their place. A scarce few outsiders believe these legends, for even to this day there has been no proper evidence of the existence of giants other than old stories and myths.  
Once the giants left Varholt, the stories continue, the Vurms came. The first adverseries of the giantbloods, these tyrannical rulers enslaved the people and the lands to their wicked will. In opposition, the people of Varholt united and warred with the Vurms. But even once they were defeated, in their last moments they had cursed the lands of Varholt with terrible magics. In accordance with the will of the giants, the giantbloods remain in Varholt to protect it and defeat the vile curses placed upon it.
